# Value Proposition Hypothesis

## Product Vision

### Problem Hypothesis

- Many organizations build, operate, and manage their workloads individually against cloud and build infrastructure in an ad hoc manner both across dev teams and cloud services. Implications:
- Undifferentiated work across service teams that does not accrue business value and slows velocity.
- Gaps versus what could be possible if investment was made centrally and amortized. When push comes to shove, engineering fundamentals will not be maximized with edge investments.
- Harder for organizational engineering talent to switch between teams because they have to learn each dev teamâ€™s approach and tooling.
- Supply chain concerns are harder to audit and alert.
- Infrastructure is managed per service team and resulting in capacity inefficiencies.

### Product Features & Benefits

#### Features

- Service teams can start new services from secure and automated template.
- Service teams can automatically deploy services to hosts matching targets.

#### Benefits

- End to end systematic software lifecycle for taking code and safely deploying it.

- Only have to be an expert in your service platform, not deployment or cloud technology.

## Market Size Hypothesis

The total addressable market (TAM) is theoretically as large as any organization that utilizes the cloud such that they have multiple applications.

That said, the serviced available market (SAM) is smaller because there are specific regulatory and industry requirements scenarios that the solution will not attempt to address. For example, the Department of Defense needs a fully air gapped deployment platform. This is not a common scenario and we will not attempt to serve this market in the near term.

Given this, the target market are organizations that 1) recognize they have a problem with deploying, operating, and managing applications left to right at an engineering level, 2) are open to accepting a standard solution in exchange for being more productive, and 3) for the first versions, can adopt a solution quickly and provide feedback. Our hypothesis is that digital natives, startups, and early enterprise adopters form the initial market that we should focus on and use to prove the pattern.
